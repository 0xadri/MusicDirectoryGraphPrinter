Manual:

	1. if you need to build the .exe file: create the .exe file ('mvn package' from the app's root dir)
	2  drop the .exe file it in the directory you want to analyse
	3. execute the file
	4. it will create the file "directorygraph-yyyy-mm-dd-HH-SS.txt" in the same directory. Check the content.



Backlog:
	1. Issue when running from path where a dir has a space in name
	2. Make this x-os (for Mac & Linux)
